// This file is a placeholder for adapting the CSS styles from
// packages/number-flow/src/styles.css and packages/number-flow/src/styles/
// to React Native's StyleSheet objects.

// The core idea is to translate CSS properties to React Native style properties.
// For example:
// .number-flow {
//   position: relative;
//   display: flex;
//   overflow: hidden;
// }
// becomes:
// const numberFlowStyles = {
//   position: 'relative',
//   display: 'flex', // View is flex by default in RN, but good to be explicit
//   overflow: 'hidden',
// };

// Animations in CSS (like @keyframes and transition properties)
// would need to be implemented using React Native's Animated API
// or a library like Reanimated. This file would primarily hold static styles.

// Note: The dynamic aspects of styling, especially those related to animations
// (e.g., --duration, --delay, --ease, transform values based on state)
// cannot be directly translated here. They would be part of the component's
// animation logic using Animated API.
// This file would store the base, static styles for the elements.
// The actual styles from the original .css files are more complex and involve
// CSS variables and pseudo-elements, which don't have direct equivalents.
// A careful review of `packages/number-flow/src/styles.css` and the animation
// logic in `NumberFlowLite` is needed to determine what can be mapped here
// and what needs to be handled dynamically in the component.
// For instance, `will-change` is a CSS optimization hint and doesn't map directly.
// `aspect-ratio` might need calculation or specific handling in RN.
// `--digit-width`, `--digit-height` would become dynamic style properties or calculated.
// The spinning animation for digits is a core visual feature that needs Animated API.
// Opacity animations too.
// Color and font styles are generally translatable.

  container: {
    // from .number-flow in styles.css

    flexDirection: 'row', // Added for RN layout
  },

  part: {

    alignItems: 'center',
