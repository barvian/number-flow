```jsx
// Basic usage:
import MotionNumber from 'motion-number'

<MotionNumber
    value={value}
    format={{ notation: 'compact' }} // Intl.NumberFormat() options
    locales="en-US" // Intl.NumberFormat() locales
/>
```

[See MDN's `Intl.NumberFormat()` reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#parameters) for a full list of `locales` and `format` options.

## Customizing

MotionNumber is a [Motion component](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/), so it accepts a `transition` prop to customize
the transitions:

<DemoTransition client:load defaultValue="code">
```jsx
import { easeOut } from 'framer-motion'

<MotionNumber
    transition={{
        // Applied to layout animations on individual characters:
        layout: { type: 'spring', duration: 0.7, bounce: 0 },
        // Used for the digit animations:
        y: { type: 'spring', duration: 0.7, bounce: 0.25 },

        // Opacity applies to entering/exiting characters.
        // Note the use of the times array, explained below:
        opacity: { duration: 0.7, ease: easeOut, times: [0, 0.3] } // 0.3s perceptual duration
    }}
/>
```
</DemoTransition>

One important note: **if you override `opacity`, make sure to give it the same duration as the layout animation**.
This improves animation performance by ensuring Framer Motion doesn't remove exiting children
until the layout animation ends. If you want the entrance/exit transitions to look shorter than the layout animations,
you can use the [`times` array](https://www.framer.com/motion/animation/##keyframes) with the format `[0, perceptualDuration]`,
as shown above. Also, make sure to use an [easing function](https://www.framer.com/motion/easing-functions/) rather than strings like `'linear'` or `'easeIn'`,
as they seem to work better. If you're using [`<MotionConfig>`](https://www.framer.com/motion/motion-config/) to set a `transition`, make sure to check the
opacity settings there as well.

Beyond the transitions, there's some CSS properties you can use to customize the display:

### `--mask-height`/`--mask-width`

These adjust the height and width of the gradient fade-out masks at the edges of the number.
`--mask-height` also gets used as the vertical padding for the number.

### `line-height`

In my opinion, the transitions look better with small vertical gaps between numbers, because it reduces the distance
the digits travel.
I recommend using the smallest `line-height` that fits all your component's characters:

```jsx
<MotionNumber style={{ lineHeight: 0.8 }} /* ... */>
```

The exact value will depend on your font and formatting options. MotionNumber uses a safe default `line-height` of 1, 
set through an inline style for simplicity. This means to override it globally you'll have to use `!important` (sorry about that; React 19 should clean this up):

```css
[data-motion-number] {
    line-height: 0.8 !important;
}
```

## Grouping

MotionNumber has four render props that can be used to synchronize other content with the number transitions:

* `before` adds elements before MotionNumber
* `first` prepends elements to MotionNumber
* `last` appends elements to MotionNumber
* `after` adds elements after MotionNumber

These can be combined to create interesting effects:

<DemoIndicator client:load>
```jsx
<MotionNumber
    value={value}
    format={{ style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }}
    after={() => (
        <MotionNumber
            value={diff}
            format={{ style: 'percent', maximumFractionDigits: 2 }}
            animate={{ backgroundColor: diff > 0 ? '#34d399' : '#ef4444' }}
            style={{ borderRadius: 999 }}
            first={() => (
                <Arrow />
            )}
        />
    )}
/>
```
</DemoIndicator>

These are also helpful because [LayoutGroup](https://www.framer.com/motion/layout-group/) doesn't currently
work with MotionNumber; see the note in [limitations](#limitations).

## LazyMotion

If you're using [`<LazyMotion>`](https://www.framer.com/motion/lazy-motion/), you can import the lazy version of
MotionNumber from:

```js
import MotionNumber from 'motion-number/lazy'
```

The API is the same.

## Limitations

* [Scientific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#scientific) and [engineering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#engineering) notations aren't currently supported
* Selected text inside the number will not respect color changes from `::selection`, if any
* `<LayoutGroup>` doesn't currently work with MotionNumber and causes noticeable jitters in the number animations.
This is likely due to MotionNumber's unusual two-step rendering process, where new digits are added before the layout animations occur.
